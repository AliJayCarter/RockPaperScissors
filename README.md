# RockPaperScissors

The game provides a user the ability to play rock paper scissors against the computer. The computer generates a random option giving the true feel of chance. The project can also provide kids the ability to see how coding can be used to create a basic game that they play with their friends.

- Furthemore the score would correctly tally up who won and keep record of the score until the reset button was pressed. The button was tested and it succesfully cleared the scores and choices of the players from the screen.
